## Exploring Global Relationships Between Surface Temperature and North Atlantic Variability 
 
## Douglas Nedza

## Introduction

For CLIM 680, I will be investigating the relationship between North Atlantic Temperature Variability measured between 80W-0W and 0N-60N, and other surface variables, such as sea surface temperature (SST), surface temperature (TS), and precipitation (PRECT) across the globe.

North Atlantic Variability is well studied, with demonstrated importance for predictability and regional climate.  Changes in surface temperature in the North Atlantic region may also be useful to monitor changes in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, which bears great impact on Northern Hemisphere weather, and may be sensitive to anthropogenic forcing.

## Data

The data used in the following analyses are taken from the CMIP5 archive and currently include the NASA GISS E2 H model and the NOAA GFDL model (depending on script, as changes have been made in the dataset used in different scripts (to be changed)).

The data used is taken from pre-industrial runs, using constant external forcing replicating the year 1850.  The use of pre-indusitral model runs prevents results from demonstrating the dominance of the anthropogenic/volanic trends, as the desired relationships characterize the internal variability of the climate system.

__NOAA/OISST__
The [NOAA/OISST](https://kpegion.github.io/COLA-DATASETS-CATALOG/sst.mnmean.nc) dataset is monthly, global sea surface temperature data from Dec, 1981 to Apr, 2020. It has horizontal resoluiton of 1deg longitude by 1deg latitude.
 
__GPCP Precipitation__
The [GPCP precipitation](https://kpegion.github.io/COLA-DATASETS-CATALOG/gpcp_precip.mon.mean.nc) is monthly global precipitation from Jan 1979 to Apr 2020. It is on a 2.5 deg longitude by 2.5 deg latitude gride.

__GHCN_CAMS__
The [GHCN_CAMS](https://kpegion.github.io/COLA-DATASETS-CATALOG/ghcn_cams) is a global, land-only, monthly temperature datasets from Jan 1948 to Mar 2020.  It is on a 0.5 deg longitude by 0.5 deg latitude grid.

__NAO Index__
The [NAO Index](https://www.psl.noaa.gov/data/correlation/nao.data) is the monthly CPC index, provided by NOAA/ESRL/PSL. It is located on the COLA servers in `/shared/ccsm4/kpegion/obs2/CLIM_INDICES/nao.data`.
