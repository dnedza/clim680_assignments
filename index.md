## Exploring Global Relationships Between Surface Temperature and North Atlantic Variability 
 
## Douglas Nedza

## Introduction

For CLIM 680, I will be investigating the relationship between North Atlantic Temperature Variability measured between 80W-0W and 0N-60N, and other surface variables, such as sea surface temperature (SST), surface temperature (TS), and precipitation (PRECT) across the globe.

North Atlantic Variability is well studied, with demonstrated importance for predictability and regional climate.  Changes in surface temperature in the North Atlantic region may also be useful to monitor changes in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, which bears great impact on Northern Hemisphere weather, and may be sensitive to anthropogenic forcing.

## Data

The datasets used in my project are:

__NOAA/OISST__
The [NOAA/OISST](https://kpegion.github.io/COLA-DATASETS-CATALOG/sst.mnmean.nc) dataset is monthly, global sea surface temperature data from Dec, 1981 to Apr, 2020. It has horizontal resoluiton of 1deg longitude by 1deg latitude.
 
__GPCP Precipitation__
The [GPCP precipitation](https://kpegion.github.io/COLA-DATASETS-CATALOG/gpcp_precip.mon.mean.nc) is monthly global precipitation from Jan 1979 to Apr 2020. It is on a 2.5 deg longitude by 2.5 deg latitude gride.

__GHCN_CAMS__
The [GHCN_CAMS](https://kpegion.github.io/COLA-DATASETS-CATALOG/ghcn_cams) is a global, land-only, monthly temperature datasets from Jan 1948 to Mar 2020.  It is on a 0.5 deg longitude by 0.5 deg latitude grid.

__NAO Index__
The [NAO Index](https://www.psl.noaa.gov/data/correlation/nao.data) is the monthly CPC index, provided by NOAA/ESRL/PSL. It is located on the COLA servers in `/shared/ccsm4/kpegion/obs2/CLIM_INDICES/nao.data`.
